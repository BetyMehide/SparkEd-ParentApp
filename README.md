#SparkEd Parent Application

SparkEd is an educational app that allows parents to personalize their child’s learning experience. Unlike other learning apps, SparkEd provides parents with the opportunity to customize the lessons and skills they teach their children, relative to their own values and beliefs. It’s designed for the remote parenting space, and ideal for parents and young children who are unable to spend time together because of location differences or time schedules. The game incorporates AI capabilities like image processing, voice interaction and drawing recognition.
